Libraries are a way to streamline your work between projects. When you share your project with your workspace, it will appear in this list.
You can only edit a library from the project it originated from.
Once added, the project uses a specific version of the library. If you or someone else publishes a new version of the library, you’ll be able to choose whether or not you want to use the latest updated version for each project.

To get started with libraries, the best way is to duplicate the template ‘Starter kit’ into your workspace and publish its library. You don’t have to publish a project to share a library, so it’s completely free.
